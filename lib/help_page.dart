  ### This page outlines all important information needed to enjoy SDG Quest.
  
  ## Purpose:
  #### 1. SDG Quest is an Educational Game with a triple goal: 
   * To raise awareness about the United Nations’ (UN) seventeen (17) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
   * To help you gain new conceptual knowledge about social, environmental, and economic sustainability
   * Inspire reflections on the attitudes towards social, environmental, and economic matters.
   * Enable positive behavioural changes, contributing to a better world for all!
   
  ### Therefore, it is important to make use of the "Hints" to explore the official United Nations (UN) resources to acquire key knowledge, attitudes, and skills!
   
  ## Game Mechanics:
  ### 1. Progression
   * “EXPERIENCE” and “POINTS” are used interchangeably to refer to the Rewards System of the SDG Quest game.
   * Points/Experience can be gained by selecting  Game-mode in the Home Page and answering the Quiz Questions.
   * Correct answers are rewarded with the Points allocated to that question. 
   * Wrong answers have no impact on Points/Experience
   * Every 100 experience a "LEVEL" is gained
      * Eventually all content can be unlocked by leveling up
   
  ### 2. Quiz
  * Answering 3 questions correctly in a row enables "STREAK MODE"
    * Streak counter refers to the number of correct answers in a row
    * The Points for Questions answered under "STREAK MODE" are MULTIPLIED by the Streak Counter.
    * Answering incorrectly sets the streak counter to 0
  * “REVEAL ANSWER” option 
    * The number of reveals depends on the size of the Quiz selected
      * "STANDARD": 3 reveals
      * "INDIVIDUAL": 1 reveal
      * "CHALLENGE": 0 reveals
    * Revealing an answer DOES NOT reset streak counter
    * Points gained for the revealed answer are NOT multiplied by streak counter
  ### 3. Certificate
  * The certificate of completion can ONLY be gained through "CHALLENGE" mode
  * Challenge mode is unlocked at "LEVEL 10" of the SDG Quest.
  * During challenge mode the "Reveal Answer" feature is disabled
  * If at least 80% of the questions are correctly answered, a personalized CERTIFICATE is issued.
